       1.  SLOAD - Saturn Linker


       SLOAD combines several object files into a single object file.  It
       resolves all references that it knows how to before outputing the
       file.  It uses a command file to decide which files to link, what
       order, at what address and allows many options for cross-reference
       tables and other forms of listings.

       The Saturn Linker/Loader is invoked as follows:

           sload [ - options <parameters> ] <command-file>

       SLOAD recognizes the following options:

         -D <symb>[=<addr>]
               Defines <symb> to be a value (default=1). For example,
               -D~Fred=1000 would set the value for the symbol Fred to
               1000 decimal.

         -H    Forces SLOAD to code only, with no symbols or references.

         -f    Allows setting of conditional load flags (only the first
               two letters of each flag are significant).

         -l    A listing file is specified. If this option is not used,
               then stdout will be the listing file.

         -m -M Specifies a file other than stdout for messages (not the
               listing file).

         -o <outfile>
               Write the object file to <outfile>.

         -p <pagelength>
               Specifies the pagelength for the listing file (default
               60).

         -w <pagewidth>
               Specifies the pagewidth for the listing file (default 80).

         -X    If unferenced entry points, exit with an error

       SLOAD accepts two letter commands from the input file. All
       characters following the first two are ignored. Certain commands
       require parameters.  An asterisk may be used in place of a hex
       address to mean the address of the next available location.
       Parameters may be separated by either a comma or a space.  The
       HElp command provides a list of commands and their parameters.
       The following are the recognized commands and a description of
       their function.  The commands may be entered in upper or lower
       case.


       ABort   Aborts the Saturn Loader.  No files are modified.

       BOundary <Hex addr> Allows the user to specify a boundary for
               locating start of next module.  The next module will start
               at an address which is a multiple to the specified
               address.  Note that address 0 is a multiple of any number.

       CHecksum <Symbol name> <Hex addr> <Hex addr>
               Specifies that a one byte checksum value should be
               computed between the specified addresses and filled in at
               the location of the specified symbol.

       CRc <Hex addr> <Hex num> <Hex num> <Hex num>
               Specifies that a 4 nibble CRC value should be computed
               according to the specified values and patched in at an
               address determined from these values.  The first parameter
               specifies where to start the CRC computation, the second
               parameter specifies the offset between reads, the third
               specifies the number of reads per half-sector and the last
               parameter specifies the number of sectors.  See
               appropriate ROM documentation for more information on CRC
               computation.

       DEfine <Symbol name> <Hex addr>
               Allows the user to define a symbol that is otherwise
               unresolved.

       ENd [ <End Option> ]
               Terminates command entry mode.  End option may be either
               of:

               NOresolverefs  Don't resolve external references.

               REsolverefs    Resolve external references.

               If no option is specified the default is RE. References
               will be resolved if not suppressed by NOresolve option.
               SLOAD will then provide listings and output modules as
               specified in command mode.

       FLag <Flag name> Set flag name specified.

       FOrce   Sets a flag that will allow user to force SLOAD to perform
               certain commands that would normally cause errors. Use
               carefully.

       HElp    Provides a list of commands as well as certain information
               about the limits of current revision of the program.

       IF <NOt>* <Flag name> <Command line>
               May precede any command line (including another IF
               command). NOt's complement value test. If test is true
               then command line is executed as if no IF statement was
               there. If test is false, then the rest of the line if
               ignored.

       LIst <List option list>
               Specifies one or more items to list as load is completed.
               List items may be turned on and off at any time during
               command mode with the final settings prevailing.  (See
               SUppress command).  Default list items are SUmmary,
               UNresolved and XRef. Any of the following are accepted:

               ALl                 List everything.

               COde                List hex dump of output module.

               ENtries             List entry points.

               LXref               List long cross-reference.

               REferences          List long cross-reference by module.

               SUmmary             List a summary of modules.

               UNresolvedRefs      List all unresolved references.

               XRef                List short cross-reference.


       LLu <File spec>
               Change listing device.  May list to a file or a device.

       LOcate <Hex addr>
               Specifies the address at which to locate the next module.
               This may be used to overlap modules if desired.

       NExt    Displays address where next nibble of code would be loaded
               if RElocate command is used.

       OPtion <Option list> Specifies type of module to output:

               COde           Output code (no symbols or references).

               SYmbols        Output symbol definitions only (no code or
                              references).

               RElocatable    (Default) Output code symbols and
                              references.

       OUtput <File spec>
               Specify name of file to output.

       PAtch <Hex addr>  <Hex nibble>*
               Patch code at address specified to have the value
               specified by the string of hex nibbles.  Zero or more hex
               nibbles may be specified.  SLOAD displays sixteen nibbles
               starting at the address specified, hence PAtch may be used
               to examine memory.  Note that external references are
               filled in following exit of command mode an may thus write
               over any patchs made. ENd NOresolverefs may be used to
               prevent this.

       RAnge <Symbol name> <Hex addr> <Hex addr>
               Check whether symbol specified is in the range specified
               and reports an error if it is not.

       RElocate <File spec>
               Specify name of file to relocate.  If no BOundary or
               LOcate command has been specified then the module is put
               at the first available nibble.  (See NExt command)

       SEarch <File spec>
               Same as relocate except only symbol definitions are
               accepted. No references or code are read in.

       SOftkey <File spec>
               Allow user to specify a softkey file to be read in when
               output module is read into software or hardware simulator.
               (This feature is not currently implemented by simulator.)

       STart <Hex addr>
               May be used before any code is read in.  Specifies
               starting address of output file.  If not specified the
               start address will be 00000.  Note that output module will
               have a length of the highest address minus this starting
               address (minus one).

       SUppress <List Option list>
               Similar to LIst command but suppresses list items.

       TItle   Allows the user to specify a title for the output module.

       TRansfer <File spec>
               Changes the device used for command input.

       UDefine <Symbol name>*
               Causes the specified symbol(s) to be undefined.  This has
               no effect on references to the symbol.  No error is given
               if the symbol doesn't previously exist.

       UNresolved <Symbol name>
               Allows the user to specify a symbol whose value is used to
               fill in all references which are otherwise unresolved.

       ZEro <Hex addr> <Hex addr>
               Sets code nibbles to zero from first address to second
               address.  Memory is not automatically zeroed when SLOAD
               starts and thus has an undefined pattern.

       ** <Comment>
               Comment line. Characters after ** are ignored.
